## Intended Architecture

This project implements a simple Azure Resource Group as the foundation for our cloud infrastructure.

### Architecture Overview

Our intended architecture consists of:

- **Azure Resource Group**: A logical container that holds related resources for our Azure solution. This serves as the foundational building block for organizing and managing our cloud resources.

### Benefits

- **Organization**: Provides a logical grouping for all related Azure resources
- **Access Control**: Enables centralized permission management through Azure RBAC
- **Cost Management**: Allows for easy cost tracking and budget allocation per resource group
- **Lifecycle Management**: Simplifies deployment, monitoring, and cleanup operations

### Next Steps

Future expansions may include:
- Virtual Network for network isolation
- Storage Account for data storage
- Compute resources (VMs or App Services)
- Security and monitoring resources
